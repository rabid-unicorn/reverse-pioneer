<p>Finally it came. The feeling I had been waiting for. I woke up and felt my heart doubled over in pain. I stood in the shower and watched the water run through my hands as I felt the dull pain thump like a rhythm through my body.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the pain of sin, or the the sinking feeling of one who regrets. It was the realization of living the rest of my life without the single most important thing previously in my life. The community I was raised in, the place where I was married, the people I called my friends, and the institution by which I learned to be a good man.</p>

<p>On Radio West a few weeks before they talked about the inevitable process of loss as you leave the church. Surely sounded like a painful experience.</p>

<p>This is kind of one of those “time will tell” situations, but at the time I could have sure gone for some outcasting, backlash, or ostracizing. At least then I’d be losing something very tactile. Even in this dreadful moment the only tangible thing I’ve lost is the thick hemming that shows along my knee line when I wear my garments.</p>

<p>As I hobbled over the seat of my bike I remembered how good it felt to not be wearing garments. It was so nice to get to work and not need to unbunch that extra layer of thick sweaty cotton. But, peddling my way to work, I couldn’t help but feel guilty for having committed a bad bargain. </p>

<p>Is truth a fair trade for community? Finally my buyer’s remorse had caught up with me, sending me mentally through the lists of pros and cons that didn’t matter until pain pushed the issue.</p>

<p>And, I suppose that I’m not talking about buyer’s remorse in the conventional sense. I’m talking about eighth grade when I started wearing all black and studs. I wanted to be noticed, somewhere (deep down) to be disciplined—and in being disciplined, to be told what to do; to be given some direction.</p>

<p>Pain often feels like progress. Pain feels like accomplishment. Pain is running a marathon, and eating some kale, and reading a lengthy piece of literature. Ostracizing is loneliness, it’s contemplation, and surrender. But instead I feel fat on the benefits of gorging. Like a salivating child before a table of sweets all my life, I’ve finally been set free and it would seem my stomach is without remorse. No cavities, no stomach aches, and no spiritual obesity has come upon me as was predicted.</p>

<p>I long for a stomach ache; I long for the guilt that I’ve surely been warned would be insufferable; I long for the love of a God withdrawn. Oh that I could feel the suffering and I could walk tail between legs back to the pathway to heaven.</p>

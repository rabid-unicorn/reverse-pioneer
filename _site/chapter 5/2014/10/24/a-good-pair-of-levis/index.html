<p>It isn’t like I have anything to do on Sunday mornings. It certainly has become more of a day of rest than it ever was during the time I fell under the title of Active.</p>

<p>Twenty-six years of church attendance can really set a deep groove into your schedule. Kind of like the rectangular shaped wear a wallet will give to a good pair of Levis—a groove so deep from such rigorous butt rubbing of the butt to the chair that even if the wallet gets left at home the faded shape remains. </p>

<p>So though I sit on my couch at home, far from the chapel pue, my mind inevitably wanders to the thoughts I would think at church, and even the games I would play on my phone during church. </p>

<p>I become judgmental in all the ways  I had become until I started feeling unprovoked judgements while lying in bed at 10:30 on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>It really is quite nice to feel the judgments bull-rush through my brain with no one to direct them toward. It’s like standing in a cool river, watching the water rush by and not caring where it will end up. It’s not quite as nice to continually be reaching for that metaphorical wallet, finding it not there, and not being able to use the things you keep inside it. Reverence, community, and ownership were feelings that I undervalued until they were no longer mine. The insecurity and nakedness of not having a wallet is much the same.</p>

<p>Where that wallet used to be the groove is worn deep, and it will likely take some kind of spiritual knee scraping before I finally get a new pair of jeans and stop reaching for that wallet. I suppose this is why near deaths, and the loss of loved ones cause people to become very polarized in their relationship with Deity. The hope is for a return of the wallet, and a patch of the knee. But probably more likely a new pair of Levis altogether—this time without that saddening groove.</p>

<p>Should I ever buy a new pair of jeans, I’m hoping I’ll have the common sense to get a pair with a strap for a hammer. Because, surely metaphorically and theologically, a hammer can only be a fantastic thing to have with you.</p>

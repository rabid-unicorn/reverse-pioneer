<p>A year into our marriage, my wife and I pursued a long standing dream of mine to live in an Airstream trailer. I had had fantasies as a teenager that included living in one a few hours East of Los Angeles, out in the middle of nowhere, with only a motorcycle, some solar panels, and a rainwater catch to survive. Beyond simple romantic idealism, this was my religion.</p>

<p>Still working on the motorcycle part. “All that happens if you quit consuming is someone else eats your lunch.” - Tom Rachman</p>

<p>An outsider to Mormonism would be able to quickly point out that Mormons have just as many tracts on Jesus Christ as they do on self sustained, within means, and debt free living. In the semi-annual conference that the church holds, just as many warnings and revelations are given about spiritual danger as there are physical hunger and comfort of living.</p>

<p>No one is a stranger the colloquial reference to something being “great and spacious”, coined by a prophet in the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>As a teenager my quest toward holiness I have had more romantic visions of self induced poverty than of running away, kissing a beautiful girl on the mouth, or winning the battle of the bands. Self sustained living was a pretty massively important undertaking, even for a brain that lacked any wide scope reasoning whatsoever.</p>

<p>When Claire and I were newly engaged, I remember the uncomfortable looks that girls would give her when she showed off her twenty dollar clay engagement ring. More than that, I remember visiting the parents of my high school best friend for a party and telling them about our engagement. They had met Claire many times, but I wouldn’t call our relationship with them a comfortable one. Still, when she held out her hand, I vividly remember the way he tilted his head, lifted one eyebrow, and drew out the word, “interesting.”</p>

<p>So here we are at 24 years old, living in a great and spacious basement apartment in the low income part of the town, finally embarking on the final quest of our lives: getting as far the hell away as we could from the intoxicating and damnable shadow cast by the great and spacious building. I’m not sure if we used the word “hell” then, but it damn well would have felt like a righteous use.</p>

<p>We held a yard sale and make a cool two-hundred bucks for a lifetime’s worth of clothes, guitar cables, and extra crock pots from wedding gifts. Personal culture felt like collateral worth giving up for the promised happiness and peace of mind.</p>

<p>I felt better about cleansing myself of those dreadful possessions than I ever have about repenting from spiritual sins.</p>

<p>My dear, wayward, grandmother pressed us with, “what will you do with all the nice things you got for your wedding?” It was easy enough for us to excuse her for being of a different time, but the pit of my stomach was trying to convince me she was less spiritually in tune for having even brought it up.</p>

<p>We got to a comfortable place with the trailer, and headed for Portland. We tried to take it easy, and gave ourselves a week to get there. </p>

<p>Claire had a hard time with the move. When we got within thirty miles of the city we decided to find a place to park near the Columbia River to sleep for the night. Claire did all the driving and found herself up a dead end on Private Property, and unable to turn our around our 47 foot rig.</p>

<p>In tears she jumped from the truck and sat on the ground, running her hands through her hair. This is the same rain dance she performs the night before an important event, or during a situation she feels like she has lost control over. Or really any time her expectations aren’t met. I’m never sure what she wants me to do in these cases. As far as I could see she wanted me back the trailer up and drive it back to Utah.</p>

<p>I squinted my eyes to watch a camp of homeless people across the river conduct a board meeting on the affairs of the River People of the East Side. One of them was likely breaking the zoning law on minimum livable space.</p>

<p>After Claire climbed back into the truck I put my hand on her leg, fanned my fingers out and gently tightened my grasp as I said to her softly, “change is hard.”</p>

<p>She had noticed the homeless people now too, to which her ten mile stare at them suggested, “I know.” </p>

<hr />

<p>The large, gay, machismo, manager of a trailer park on Killingsworth street was sitting across the desk from us in the office room of the double wide trailer he lived in with his partner 21-years-the-younger. Charles wasn’t always his name, with a frown he nodded to a small brown plaque perched on the furthest edge of his desk. He changed it after the divorce to his wife of 25 years.</p>

<p>His perfectly parted high and tight haircut stood heroically against the onslaught of breeze provided by the three floor fans surrounding him. The temperature was 78 degrees.</p>

<p>Our conversation followed like this:</p>

<p>“So you want to move in. You and your,” he paused filling out paperwork, pointing to me with his elbow.
“Husband.”
“Husband? You’re really married, for real,” Charles continued to frown through his questions.
“Uh-huh.”
“Well. Lots-a kids roaming round the park, but your spot’ll be hitched on a solid slab of concrete. No grass, not much fun for little ones.”
“We don’t have any kids.”
“How old are you?”
“Twenty-four.”
He nodded at me again.
“Twenty-five.”
“You’re twenty-god-damn-years-old and you didn’t get married because you got pregnant?”
“Uh, yup,” she laughed shortly, sucking in hard after each sound.
“Well. You are a rare breed here,” he said, punctuating each word with a pause.</p>

<p>He also told me us he has one rule, which is do whatever you want in your trailer, just don’t bring it outside. “I don’t care if you knock your husband around, just keep it in the trailer.”</p>

<p>Fir Grove is my favorite place we’ve ever lived. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a stressful first week. It’s quite a shock to choose to live in that level of poverty. Lots of drug deals seen, lots of thefts witnessed. But also, that neighborhood (Cully) is my favorite part of Portland. Our experience would have been totally different if we hadn’t seen that beautifully depressed part of town. Great people who care and watch out for those who are close to them.</p>

<p>Two of the park’s little ones spent a lot of time playing with Joshua, who spent a lot of time that summer laying under one of the only two firs that made up Fir Grove. With the shame of not being able to “keep it in the trailer”, their dad came screaming one day that they were not to leave while he was giving a tattoo.</p>

<p>Nobody really ever did keep it in the trailer. Not the man living two feet behind us, whose 2am shouting to a prostitute he biblically referred to as, “his sister,” saw him shipped out by noon the next day. Not the woman whose turrets (we could only pray) caused her to scream all bloody murder each night at around 10. And not Claire and I, whose insatiable frustrations with being poor, lonely, and stuck living in a perpetually broken trailer lead to many fights, and even me hastily backing our truck (the only someone nice thing we owned) into a fire hydrant.</p>

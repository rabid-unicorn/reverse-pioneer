<p>I’m having a problem knowing what I believe anymore. I do sustain that the intangible experience of going through a sensation (provoked or unprovoked) is real and of spiritual value. So, generally speaking I use that little compass as my guide in making clarity of life. I no longer want to find truth, or to simplify life, just to find clarity.</p>

<p>I’ve made myself a little notebook to help me understand what feels clear or right for me. On page one is God, and the indication that I believe him to exist, and the date in which I believe him to have last been real. I have also allowed sufficient space to change my mind on that.</p>

<p>On page two is God as Father, and the indication that I’m not really sure of this. I survived on him being a Father for a long time, because the father-son relationship was easy to develop based on expectations and accomplishments.</p>

<p>On page 4 is God as Verbal Communicator in which I have indicated that I no longer believe this to be true. With this as false, so fall all the words in the Bible, all the words ever written by a prophet, or anyone who claims to speak in the name of God. Which isn’t to say those words are or aren’t true, just that they are no longer the word of God. </p>

<p>My own dad isn’t much of a verbal communicator, but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand or know his expectations for me (specifically). But I don’t verbally communicate with the CEO of the company I work for, and that does mean that I don’t understand or know his expectations for me (specifically).</p>

<p>And this is where I am with God who once was but now might not be my father. He may be very pleased with me, but I am not sure that our relationship is one of command and obey like it once was. It has become something more complex, and much less pleasurable. One where I must experiment my way through life, only to find where the lines of demarcation are after having crossed them and learned why they were there. </p>

<p>It’s not as bad as it sounds. I was getting close to this belief within Mormonism, but my cognitive dissonance prevented me from really taking advantage of this form of relationship.</p>

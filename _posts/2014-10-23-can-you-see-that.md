I Wonder if You Can See That

The Type@Cooper program is a five week intensive, post-graduate certificate course, held at the Cooper Union in the East Village in New York City. I first heard about it while working as an intern for a graduate of the course.

Andy is one of the primary instructors of the course. He is respected among type designers. He has a sense for quality and aesthetics that I decided I was there to learn. I decided I was in New York, paying a large amount of money to learn, so I was damn well going to learn. I decided my own taste would get in the way of learning so I would put my taste aside. I would learn Andy's taste.

Taste, like athletism, seems to be most sought for in the moment it aludes you. Like longing for more strength while being outperformed, it seems that we only look taste in the eye mid immasculation. And in that moment that you crave it, you have lost something in yourself that taste requires: confidence. Taste is a most snobby cat.

Taste is an exercise, it is not an education. It is the ability to reason with abstract shapes and contextualize them appropriately. Some artists are exercised in colors, others in forms. The practice of designing a typeface is an exercise in the rhythm of form and counterform; this course was a form and counterform bootcamp.

The exercise began slowly at first. On the third day I sat on a windowseal of the primary studio, looking down over Cooper Square, smelling pizza and tar and urine while casually turning pages of a shitty paperback. The counterforms of the type the book was set in were catching my eye. I was frustrated that I could not read but it felt like progress.

Letters are drawn in an order and that order is not alphabetical. Type design is linear and modular, with most of the important decisions made early on in the foundational characters: o and h. Printed proofs are made throughout the process. Early proofs only include two letters: o and h. These two letters are showcased in proofs in every conceivable variety.

hoho ho oh ohhohooh oo hh ohho

These two letters present us with our first question: does anything unessesarily stand out?

I wonder if you can see the gentle rhythm in the deterioration of your perenials and peonies? When you get home from New York and you see that the season has passed, and you fetch your shears to cut dead blossom from dead stem do you do it with a steady hand?

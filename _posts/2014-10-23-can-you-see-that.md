I Wonder if You Can See That

The Type@Cooper program is a five week intensive, post-graduate certificate course, held at the Cooper Union in the East Village in New York City. I first heard about it as an intern for a graduate of the course.

Andy, one of the primary instructors of the course, is one of the most successful and respected type designers. He had a sense for quality and aesthetics that I was there to learn. I decided I was in New York, paying a ludicris amount of money to learn, so I was damn well going to get my money's worth. I would put my taste aside, and learn Andy's taste.

Taste, like athletism, seems to be most sought for in the moment it aludes us. Like longing for more strength while being outperformed, it seems that we only look taste in the eye just as it immasculates us. And in that moment that you crave it, you have lost it.

Taste is an exercise, it is not an education. It is the ability to reason with abstract shapes and contextualize them appropriately. Some artists are exercised in colors, others in forms. The practice of designing a typeface is an exercise in rhythm and space; Andy was well exercised in that practice.

The exercise begins slowly, like stretching. Proofs are made with only two letters on them: h and o. These two are repeated in a variety of ways.

hoho ho oh ohhohooh oo hh ohho

These two letters present us with our first question: does anything unessesarily stand out?

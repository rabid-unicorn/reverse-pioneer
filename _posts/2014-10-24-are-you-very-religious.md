"Are we okay? Did you ditch me on purpose?"

"No, no. Of course not. Just trying to meet up with my coworkers," I said, looking down and praying to the God of Bowling for a group text notification to come through. 

She looked at me with eyes that had understanding, "did I freak you out?"

"No, it's fine. I'm fine. Really."

"Do you drink?"

"Not anymore," I lied, "I'm happier this way."

"It's good that you know yourself like that."

The music was still too loud. It was much easier to talk out on the porch.

"I want to be your friend," she said as she pressed her phone into my hand, an empty new contact form on the screen. She looked up up at me and I looked down at her as her expression shifted to match the conflicted look in mine.

"I didn't see you smile until we drew each other."

"What," I said incredulously, as she excidedly nodded.

"Yep," she continued through hurried nods, "you were doing that networking smile at first, but there was this amazing moment while I was drawing you where you relaxed, and you were like, 'okay, I'm being memorialized, time to show off the good stuff.'"

"Oh yeah," I laughed, still shouting over the music, "like Cannal street? I was hiding hiding the good shit until it was asked for?"

Mature women in blazers were shaking their round asses in front of us. The business woman two step. Alcohol does amazing things with round assed women. I was still holding her phone, just finishing up the contact information by writing in the non-incriminating title, "dude from Utah".

"I feel so close to you. We're going to be friends for life."

A handsome twenty-something year old dude, with a hitler youth haircut and a slim black tie, cut through the sea of asses and introduced himself as her husband, hardly stopping before continuing off in another direction. He was David Beckham handsome.

"He can be socially awkward. Don't mind him," she said leaning further into my side.

Kyle,
I haven't checked my other email since about April 10th, and I'm not going to check it anymore.
I'm no longer interested in making Joshua available to you.

I quickly surveyed the room and found the cutest girl.

"Do you mind if I sit here," I shouted while swinging my ass down in the spot next to her before she could prepare a response.

"I am trying to meet new people," I excused my excitement. 

My co-workers, all of them married, loved watching me sprint about the conference all flush in the cheeks with business cards in hand. It was just eight months since Claire and I had seperated, and I was feeling some false urgency to get on with the rest of my life.

"I've been trying to network, but I guess my style of networking is being a body with ears who just sits down and waits for people to network with me," she said while laughing gently over the last few words.

"Are you from around here?"

"Yeah, well, Syracuse, but I've been in Manhatten exactly one year today."

"Congratulations," I said, though I immediately thought of the joke, "Congratuhatten," and wish I had said it instead.

She was about three whiskeys in, and wrapping her arm around mine when she said, as if it had been on her mind for a while, "are you still very religious then?"

We were at the afterparty, standing out on the porch, and it was beginning to get pretty cold. My hands were folded tight against my chest, and my she leaning up against me. 

"No, I mean, not according to the definition of 'religious' that I was raised with," I said reverently, "my family all stopped going to church this year, actually."

"What? You're kidding."

"It's kind of silly. Well it's ridiculous. I always set unacheivable goals for myself at New Years, so this year I set a goal to bowl a 300—which is only funny if you know that I am not a bowler.

"So I started bowling on Sundays, and my family wanted to come along. Now they don't go to church. It's all my fault," I said as we broke into laughter.

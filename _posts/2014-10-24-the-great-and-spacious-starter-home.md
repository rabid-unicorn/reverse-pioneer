It became official while closing on our first house. And Jessica Christensen, our loan officer, was the first person we told that we were getting divorced.

A year into our marriage, my wife and I pursued a long standing dream of mine to live in an old Airstream trailer. Beyond simple romantic idealism, this was also my religion.

Mormons have just as many tracts on Jesus Christ as they do on self sustained, within means, and debt free living. In the semi-annual conference that the church holds, there are warnings of famine and fear to come. It's made clear in those heavily respected meetings that although we should be industrius and prepared for those famines to come, we should stay away from "great and spacious building[s]". We are to walk the line between preparation and overabundance. 

Self sustained living is a big deal to Mormons. But as a pubesent with no wide scope spacial reasoning, my romantic goals of living on the road in a Silver Bullet probably had more to do with MTV than it did spiritual insight. Nevertheless, at the time it served its purposes as a convenient way to understand God.

When Claire and I were newly engaged, there were many uncomfortable looks girls would give her when she showed off her twenty dollar clay engagement ring. We weren't traditional in a lot of ways, so it was easy to just shrug it off. Hell, we were trying to be proud about living within our means, and never-the-minding what the haters had to say.

Around that time we visited some family friends to announce our engagement. They had met Claire many times, but I wouldn’t call her relationship with them a completely comfortable one. Still, when she held out her hand, I vividly remember the way the father tilted his head, lifted one eyebrow, and dropped his tone to drawl out, “interesting.”

-------

At 24 years old, then living in a great and spacious basement apartment in the low income part of Provo, UT, we embarked on our final holy quest: stripping ourselves of the damnable shadow cast by commercialism. We earnestly believed commercialism and living out of our means was keeping us from happiness and peace.

We held a yard sale and made a cool two-hundred bucks for a lifetime’s worth of clothes, guitar cables, and leftover wedding gift crock pots. What we pawned off that day felt like social collateral worth sacraficing for the peace we felt owed to us. Cleansing myself of those dreadful possessions felt better than I'd ever felt previously from repenting of any cannonical sins.

Still my wayward grandmother pressed us with, “what will you do with your wedding gifts?” I couldn't help but wondering how she was doing spiritually for asking.

After a year of restoring and repairing, testing and boondocking, we hit the road for Portland in a 1966 Airstream Overlander. We took it easy, being truly free for the first time in our lives. We would hold our arms wide for the next year, faithfully waiting for that peace to wash over us.

But Claire had a hard time with the move. About 30 miles before arriving in Portland we pulled off the freeway, near the Columbia River, to sleep for the night. In the process Claire found herself up a dead end without the space for all 47 feet of us to turn around.

In tears she jumped from the truck and sat on the ground, running her hands through her hair. She performed a rain dance like this one every Sunday night while in college, before each plane trip to visit her parents, and generally whenever she had driven the trailer into dead ends on private property. 

The look in her eyes screamed that I should put the truck in reverse and not stop until we were back in Utah. After a few minutes Claire climbed back into the truck. I put my hand on her leg and gently tightened my grasp as I said to her softly, “growth is no fun. We'll figure this out.”

She didn't speak, but her ten mile stare suggested, “this isn't what I signed up for.”

Charles, frowning, nodded to a small brown plaque perched on the furthest edge of his desk which read, "Resident Manager". The obese, gay, machismo manager of a trailer park on Killingsworth street was sitting across from us in the front room of the double wide trailer he lived in with his partner 21-years-the-younger.

His perfectly parted high and tight haircut stood heroically against the wind coming from three rotary fans on full blast.

Our conversation followed:

“So you want to move in. You and your,” he paused from filling out paperwork, pointing to me with his elbow.
“Husband,” Claire said quickly.
“Husband? You’re really married, for real,” Charles continued to frown through his questions.
“Uh-huh.”
“Well. Lots-a kids roaming round the park, but your spot’ll be hitched on a solid slab of concrete. No grass, not much fun for little ones.”
“We don’t have any kids.”
“How old are you?”
“Twenty-four.”
He turned to me.
“Twenty-five.”
“You’re twenty-god-damn-years-old and you didn’t get married because you got pregnant?”
“Uh, yup,” Claire laughed shortly, sucking in briskly after each "ha".
Punctuating each word with a pause, he said, “Well. You are a rare breed here.”

In the brief interview he told us his only rule: go about your business as you please, just don’t bring it outside. “I don’t care if you knock your husband around, just keep it in the trailer.”

Nobody really ever did keep it in the trailer. Certainly not the man directly behind us, whose 2am shouting at a prostitute (he affectionatly referred to as, “his sister,”) got him evicted by noon the next day. Not the woman whose turrets (we could only pray) caused her to scream all bloody murder each night at around midnight. And not Claire and I, whose insatiable frustrations with being poor, lonely, and stuck living in a perpetually broken trailer lead to many fights. One fight was so bad that the blood in my face kept me from remembering a fire hydrant before I hastily backed our truck into it.

This is almost certainly why Mormonism thrives in the sprawl-ed suburbs of the West where there are a great many rooms and spacious fields whereby we can hide our problems from our neighbors. The trailer was small enough to forget our commercial wowes, but not big enough to remember our marital vows.

<!-- Most Mormons are comfortable with that rule. In order to be a clean glass through which people can see Jesus, Mormons need to keep a clean public appearance. Good grooming, public non-confrontation, and steady employment are all expectations of cultural Mormonism; or putting it simply: "keep it in the trailer". 

Fir Grove , though the first week was less than ideal.

Fir Grove is still one of my favorite places. Even with the crime—the drug deals and the thefts, the three strip clubs across the street, and the mangy homeless dogs—that neighborhood became my home. I got to see the subtle beauties of a community in depression. Offers of protection, free beer and food were near constant. They were good people who cared and watched out for those they invited in. 

They were the glimmer of gold on my road to El Dorado. They were a humble, who didn't have the ability to let possessions burden them. But still one thing troubled me: they didn't have peace. I was owed peace for my sacrice.

It was there that I learned that the wealthiest choice you can make is to choose poverty. In Fir Grove, our just-finished-college style poor looked like the height of luxury. It was there that I questioned if I could ever live a self sustained, within means, and peaceful life.

<!-- A couple of the few kids in the park spent a lot of time playing with Joshua, who spent a lot of time that summer laying under one of the only two firs that made up Fir Grove. With the shame of not being able to “keep it in the trailer”, their dad came screaming one day that they were not to leave while he was giving a tattoo. -->

A year later, hearts broken and heads humbled, we stumbled back to Utah. I was pretty vocal about needing space. And though our now meager belongings only filled a small corner of the new 1,200 sq/ft apartment we moved into, I remained gasping for air from the year long marathon in 120 sq/ft.

A good job, many more fights, and nine months later I bought a house on a .33 acre lot, with high ceilings and a garage the size of four Airstreams. That was also when Claire left. The house didn't cause the seperation, but it did demark it. I to my great and spacious, and her to a yurt. Each walking in opposite directions, in search of the gospel we'd been promised.

It became official while closing on our first house. And Jessica Christensen, our loan officer, was the first person we told that we were getting divorced.

A year into our marriage, my wife and I pursued a long standing dream of mine to live in an old Airstream trailer. Beyond simple romantic idealism, this was also my religion.

Mormons have just as many tracts on Jesus Christ as they do on self sustained, within means, and debt free living. In the semi-annual conference that the church holds, there are abundent warnings given on famine and revelations on prepardness. It's made pretty clear in those widely attended and quoted meetings that although we should be industrius we should stay away from "great and spacious building[s]": we must walk the line between being preparation and overabundance. 

As a Mormon pubesent my holy quest brought visions and daydreams of self sustained living. I was riddled with fantasies of living in that trailer (that "Silver Bullet") a few hours East of Los Angeles, out in the middle of nowhere, with only a motorcycle, and a bag of sunflower seeds. Being blessed at the time with a brain that lacked any wide scope spacial reasoning, I can only assume that kind of big picture thinking had more to do with brainwashing and MTV than it did spiritual insight.

When Claire and I were newly engaged, I remember the uncomfortable looks that girls would give her when she showed off her twenty dollar clay engagement ring. Nevermind what the haters say, we were living within my means.

Around that time we visited the parents of my high school best friend and told them about our engagement. They had met Claire many times, but I wouldn’t call our relationship with them a comfortable one. Still, when she held out her hand, I vividly remember the way he tilted his head, lifted one eyebrow, and dropped into a drawl with the word, “interesting.”

-------

So here we are at 24 years old, living in a great and spacious basement apartment in the low income part of the town, finally embarking on the final quest of our lives: getting as far the hell away as we could from the intoxicating and damnable shadow cast by commercialism and urban sprawl. At the heart of it we saw those things as addicting and unbecoming of anyone who wanted the true richness of life.

We held a yard sale and made a cool two-hundred bucks for a lifetime’s worth of clothes, guitar cables, and leftover wedding gift crock pots. What we pawned off that day felt like social collateral worth sacraficing for the consequential peace we felt owed to us. Cleansing myself of those dreadful possessions felt better I ever have felt about repenting from any cannonical sins.

Still my dear, wayward, grandmother pressed us with, “what will you do with your wedding gifts?” Sure she's from a different time, but it seemed more evident to us then that she gave herself away as less spiritually in tune by asking.

After a year of restoring and repairing, testing and boondocking, we hit the road for Portland. Taking it easy, we gave ourselves a week to travel the 12 hours of driving.

Claire had a hard time with the move. We found a place near the Columbia River, about 30 miles East of the city, to sleep for the night. Claire did all the driving and in the process found herself up a dead end on private property without the space to turn around our 47 foot long rig.

In tears she jumped from the truck and sat on the ground, running her hands through her hair. This rain dance wasn't new. She performed it every Sunday night in college, each plane trip to visit her parents and generally whenever she had driven the trailer into dead ends on private property. 

In that moment she wanted me to put the truck in reverse and not stop until we were back home in Utah.

I squinted my eyes to watch a camp of homeless people across the river conduct a board meeting on the affairs of the River People of the East Side. No doubt more than one of them was breaking the zoning law on minimum livable space.

After Claire climbed back into the truck I put my hand on her leg, fanned my fingers out and gently tightened my grasp as I said to her softly, “growth is no fun.”

She had noticed the homeless people now too, to which her ten mile stare at them suggested, “I know.”

Charles, frowning, nodded to a small brown plaque perched on the furthest edge of his desk which read, "Resident Manager". The obese, gay, machismo manager of a trailer park on Killingsworth street was sitting across it in the front room of the double wide trailer he lived in with his partner 21-years-the-younger.

His perfectly parted high and tight haircut stood heroically against the wind coming from three rotary fans.

Our conversation followed like this:

“So you want to move in. You and your,” he paused filling out paperwork, pointing to me with his elbow.
“Husband.”
“Husband? You’re really married, for real,” Charles continued to frown through his questions.
“Uh-huh.”
“Well. Lots-a kids roaming round the park, but your spot’ll be hitched on a solid slab of concrete. No grass, not much fun for little ones.”
“We don’t have any kids.”
“How old are you?”
“Twenty-four.”
He nodded at me again.
“Twenty-five.”
“You’re twenty-god-damn-years-old and you didn’t get married because you got pregnant?”
“Uh, yup,” Claire laughed shortly, sucking in briskly after each "ha".
Punctuating each word with a pause, he said, “Well. You are a rare breed here.”

In the brief interview he told us his only rule: go about your business as you please, just don’t bring it outside. “I don’t care if you knock your husband around, just keep it in the trailer.” We were comfortable with that rule. Most Mormons are. In order to be a clean glass through which people can see Jesus, Mormons need to keep a clean public appearance. Good grooming, public non-confrontation, and steady employment are all expectations of cultural Mormonism; or putting it simply: "keep it in the trailer".

Fir Grove turned out to be my favorite place we've ever lived, though the first week was less than ideal. Our just-finished-college style poor looked like the height of luxury there; it was there that I learned that the wealthiest choice you can make is to choose poverty. 

Even with the crime—the drug deals and the thefts, the three strip clubs across the street, and the mangy homeless dogs—that neighborhood became home to me. I got to see the subtle beauties of a community in depression. Offers of protection, free beer and food were near constant. They were good people who cared and watched out for those they invited in.

<!-- A couple of the few kids in the park spent a lot of time playing with Joshua, who spent a lot of time that summer laying under one of the only two firs that made up Fir Grove. With the shame of not being able to “keep it in the trailer”, their dad came screaming one day that they were not to leave while he was giving a tattoo. -->

Nobody really ever did keep it in the trailer. Certainly not the man directly behind us, whose 2am shouting at a prostitute (he affectionatly referred to as, “his sister,”) got him evicted by noon the next day. Not the woman whose turrets (we could only pray) caused her to scream all bloody murder each night at around 10. And not Claire and I, whose insatiable frustrations with being poor, lonely, and stuck living in a perpetually broken trailer lead to many fights. One fight was so bad that the blood in my face kept me from remembering not to hastily back our truck (the only somewhat nice thing we owned) into a fire hydrant.

This is almost certainly why Mormonism thrives in the sprawl-ed suburbs of the West where there are a great many rooms and spacious fields whereby we can hide our problems from our neighbors. The trailer was small enough to forget our commercial wowes, but not big enough to remember our marital vows.

Eventually we landed in Utah, and I was pretty vocal about needing space. And though our belongings only filled a small corner of the new 1,200 sq/ft apartment we moved into, I remained gasping for air from the year long marathon in 120 sq/ft.

A year after that I bought a house on a .33 acre lot, with high ceilings and a 1000 sq/ft garage. That was also when Claire left. The house didn't cause the seperation, but it did demark it. Me to my great and spacious, and her to a yurt. Each walking in oppossite directions, in search of the gospel we'd been promised.

It became official while closing on our first house. And Jessica Christensen, our loan officer, was the first person we told that we were getting divorced.

A year into our marriage, my wife and I pursued a long standing dream of mine to live in an old Airstream trailer. I had had fantasies as a teenager that included living a few hours East of Los Angeles, out in the middle of nowhere, with only a motorcycle, some solar panels, and a rainwater catch to survive. Beyond simple romantic idealism, this was also my religion.

Mormons have just as many tracts on Jesus Christ as they do on self sustained, within means, and debt free living. In the semi-annual conference that the church holds, there are abundent warnings given on famine and revelations on prepardness. And although we should be industrius and prepared it is made just as colloquially clear that we should stay away from "great and spacious building[s]". We must walk the line between being preparation and overabundance. 

As a Mormon pubesent my holy quest brought visions and daydreams of self sustained living. Being blessed at the time with a brain that lacked any wide scope spacial reasoning, I can only assume that kind of big picture thinking has more to do with brainwashing than it did intelligence.

When Claire and I were newly engaged, I remember the uncomfortable looks that girls would give her when she showed off her twenty dollar clay engagement ring. Nevermind what the haters say, we were living within my means and was more spiritually wise than the mockers.

Around that time we visited the parents of my high school best friend and told them about our engagement. They had met Claire many times, but I wouldn’t call our relationship with them a comfortable one. Still, when she held out her hand, I vividly remember the way he tilted his head, lifted one eyebrow, and dropped into a drawl with the word, “interesting.”

So here we are at 24 years old, living in a great and spacious basement apartment in the low income part of the town, finally embarking on the final quest of our lives: getting as far the hell away as we could from the intoxicating and damnable shadow cast by commercialism and urban sprawl. I’m not sure if we used the word “hell” then, but I am sure that we saw those things as addicting and unbecoming of anyone who wanted the richness that life had to provide.

We held a yard sale and make a cool two-hundred bucks for a lifetime’s worth of clothes, guitar cables, and leftover wedding gift crock pots. The personal culture we pawned off that day felt like collateral worth sacraficing for the happiness and peace we felt owed to us.

Cleansing myself of those dreadful possessions felt better I ever have about repenting from cannonical sins.

Still my dear, wayward, grandmother pressed us with, “what will you do with your wedding gifts?” Sure she's from a different time, but it seemed more plausable then that she was less spiritually in tune for having even brought it up.

After a year of restoring and repairing, testing and boondocking, we hit the road for Portland. Taking it easy, we gave ourselves a week to travel the 12 hours of driving.

Claire had a hard time with the move. We found a place near the Columbia River, about 30 miles East of the city, to sleep for the night. Claire did all the driving and in the process found herself up a dead end on private property without the space to turn around our 47 foot long rig.

In tears she jumped from the truck and sat on the ground, running her hands through her hair. This rain dance wasn't new. She performed it every Sunday night in college, each plane trip to visit her parents and in general during situations where she has driven the trailer into private property dead ends. In that moment she wanted me to put the truck in reverse and not stop until we were back home in Utah.

I squinted my eyes to watch a camp of homeless people across the river conduct a board meeting on the affairs of the River People of the East Side. No doubt more than one of them was breaking the zoning law on minimum livable space.

After Claire climbed back into the truck I put my hand on her leg, fanned my fingers out and gently tightened my grasp as I said to her softly, “growth is no fun.”

She had noticed the homeless people now too, to which her ten mile stare at them suggested, “I know.”

Charles, frowning, nodded to a small brown plaque perched on the furthest edge of his desk which read, "Resident Manager". The obese, gay, machismo manager of a trailer park on Killingsworth street was sitting across the desk from us in the office room of the double wide trailer he lived in with his partner 21-years-the-younger.

His perfectly parted high and tight haircut stood heroically against the onslaught of wind coming from the three rotary fans that surrounded him. The temperature was 78 degrees.

Our conversation followed like this:

“So you want to move in. You and your,” he paused filling out paperwork, pointing to me with his elbow.
“Husband.”
“Husband? You’re really married, for real,” Charles continued to frown through his questions.
“Uh-huh.”
“Well. Lots-a kids roaming round the park, but your spot’ll be hitched on a solid slab of concrete. No grass, not much fun for little ones.”
“We don’t have any kids.”
“How old are you?”
“Twenty-four.”
He nodded at me again.
“Twenty-five.”
“You’re twenty-god-damn-years-old and you didn’t get married because you got pregnant?”
“Uh, yup,” she laughed shortly, sucking in briskly after each "ha".
Punctuating each word with a pause, he said, “Well. You are a rare breed here.”

In the lengthy interview he also told us his only rule: do whatever you want in your trailer, just don’t bring it outside. “I don’t care if you knock your husband around, just keep it in the trailer.”

Fir Grove is my favorite place we've ever lived. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a stressful first week. It's quite a shock to choose to live in that level of poverty. Lots of drug deals observed, lots of thefts seen. Even with the crime, the three strip clubs across the street, and the mangy dogs that neighborhood quickly became my favorite part of Portland. I feel entirely lucky I got to see first hand such a beautifully depressed part of this country. Great people who care and watch out for those who are close to them.

Two of the park’s little ones spent a lot of time playing with Joshua, who spent a lot of time that summer laying under one of the only two firs that made up Fir Grove. With the shame of not being able to “keep it in the trailer”, their dad came screaming one day that they were not to leave while he was giving a tattoo.

Nobody really ever did keep it in the trailer. Not the man living two feet behind us, whose 2am shouting to a prostitute he biblically referred to as, “his sister,” saw him shipped out by noon the next day. Not the woman whose turrets (we could only pray) caused her to scream all bloody murder each night at around 10. And not Claire and I, whose insatiable frustrations with being poor, lonely, and stuck living in a perpetually broken trailer lead to many fights, and even me hastily backing our truck (the only someone nice thing we owned) into a fire hydrant.

I’m having a problem knowing what I believe anymore. I do sustain that the intangible experience of going through a sensation (provoked or unprovoked) is real and of spiritual value. So, generally speaking I use that little compass as my guide in making clarity of life. I no longer want to find truth, or to simplify life, just to find clarity.

I’ve made myself a little notebook to help me understand what feels clear or right for me. On page one is God, and the indication that I believe him to exist, and the date in which I believe him to have last been real. I have also allowed sufficient space to change my mind on that.

On page two is God as Father, and the indication that I’m not really sure of this. I survived on him being a Father for a long time, because the father-son relationship was easy to develop based on expectations and accomplishments.

On page 4 is God as Verbal Communicator in which I have indicated that I no longer believe this to be true. With this as false, so fall all the words in the Bible, all the words ever written by a prophet, or anyone who claims to speak in the name of God. Which isn’t to say those words are or aren’t true, just that they are no longer the word of God. 

My own dad isn’t much of a verbal communicator, but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand or know his expectations for me (specifically). But I don’t verbally communicate with the CEO of the company I work for, and that does mean that I don’t understand or know his expectations for me (specifically).

And this is where I am with God who once was but now might not be my father. He may be very pleased with me, but I am not sure that our relationship is one of command and obey like it once was. It has become something more complex, and much less pleasurable. One where I must experiment my way through life, only to find where the lines of demarcation are after having crossed them and learned why they were there. 

It’s not as bad as it sounds. I was getting close to this belief within Mormonism, but my cognitive dissonance prevented me from really taking advantage of this form of relationship.

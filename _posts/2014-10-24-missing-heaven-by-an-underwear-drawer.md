After months of shoving aside heaps of greying garments, I finally bagged up the mess of them and took them down to the basement. A sufficient amount of time was spent pretending that keeping these in my underwear drawer came even close to covenant keeping.

I scurried down the stairs and unceremoniously tossed the knotted closed grocery bag between our unused bike trailer and my rather new looking skateboard. Like once proud champions, now tired from the fight, the three slumped against each other for support. 

No joke, in there day they really were champions. For each my heart still holds a little bit of guilt. A little guilt for each member of the basement catalog of lost ideals. Before I turn and shut the door, my eyes pause on the heap. With each step up the stairs my heart aches to be able to do kickflips while wearing garments for the rest of my life.

Here I am wondering if I’ll miss heaven by an underwear drawer. Even so, it’s not a bad way to go. Surely God is not perfect, and superficial like the rest of us, he would look on the heart in every judgement case but mine. For me, he’d simply look at the way my shirt hangs on my frame and know I wasn’t wearing the cut of the right cloth.

After pulling the Hell lever on me, he’d say, “next,” and pull a ruler out to measure the distance between the head and the heart of the new quivering child in front of him. “Nineteen inches,” he’d mutter to himself, “shame.”

Where observable and measurable goes, religion is laden with these types of rubrics. Orthodoxy loves its gematria, its quantitative penance, and Mormonism has its fair share. A deacon, who God-willing remembers to put on underwear and clean his face everyday, is prevented from passing the sacrament if his shirt color is anything but white. An attender is ostracized if they put off a  smell just a few degrees south of smokeless.

I suppose that even the basement isn’t far enough to be considered abandoned. Maybe God gives leeway to those who codependently hold onto underwear rather than throw it out. I’m sure he uses measuring tape for those judgements. Using a ruler would look silly. 

But I wish I could abandon them. Hell, more than that I wish I could dye them black, roll up and cuff the ends, and hem the shirts into tank tops.

Worse than missing heaven by an underwear drawer is missing it by...

"The most commonly used word in 2014 was the heart emoji," said Danny.

"The heart emoji is not a word," exclaimed Rachel.

"A word is only an abstraction," I said, surprising even myself with how dismissive I sounded. I cleared my throat and paused before starting again, "H-E-A-R-T is only an abstraction meant to communicate both the literal and the figurative. There is nothing concrete about those letters and the history of human languages is a testiment to that."

The office was quickly made silent as everyone turned their chairs back to their monitors.

"A design can communicate a concept and a feeling much more readily and sometimes more emotionally than a sentence," I continued but Rachel quickly interupted me, "they're different."

Garments are an abstraction for the magnitude of the commitment to God, and they are also a literal sheild against the power of the devil.

Many things are abstractions, for me lately. Abstractions are tricky, because their definitions can change based on context and tone. Calling garments, "Jesus Jamies," doesn't change the physical entity, but it can change the abstract concept of commitment through trivializing their significance.

I have met Mormons who have lost all sense of the abstract for their garments and begin using them for the very practical purposes like: physical protection from bullets and/or car accidents, undershirt to look classly beneath a sheer top, affordable (though completely counter-sexual) underwear, and often (after turning tired and yellow) as shop rags.

Here was Rachel, a friend, making a face she only needs to make to communicate with me: okay, Kyle, I get the point.

Inserting one last position, I mumbled, "what do you think people did before the alphabet?"

Which begs the question, how do I communicate the implied or the abstract without the symbols of my God?

In July of 2014 I decided to stop shoving aside heaps of holy garments to get to my secular underwear. I had stopped believing I was righteous just for keeping the garments in my wardrobe.

I bagged up the now light grey mess and unceremoniously tossed them in the far corner near the water heater in the storage space beneath the house.

I suppose that even the basement isn’t far enough for them to be considered abandoned. Does my God give leeway to those who recycle their old garments as shop rags?

But I wish I could abandon them. More than that I wish I could wear them and feel that they meant what they once did.

Big Bend National Park is in the middle of nowhere. It's about three hours drive from the nearest gas station. Three hours of driving is pretty long when you're fighting. Claire and I were driving from Brownsville, after a week long visit with her sister Melinda and brother-in-law Mike. The drive so far had been uneventful; the week had been painful and long.

When we first arrived in Brownsville, we parked our 27' rig of truck and trailer a few blocks away from Mike and Melinda's condo. They weren't sure how their neighbors would receive us. I gathered my headphones, stray  cables, and laptop into my backpack as Claire directed Joshua from the cab up into the trailer. The street was fairly busy, the trailer shaking with each passing car. Claire readied a pile of vegan bible bread sandwiches, and Joshua's homemade corn meal mush, while I pulled out my laptop and tried to find an open wifi signal to submit my day's work. We had figured that I needed to make $120 a day in order to get by.

Mike and Melinda got home from work just after six, and came mosying through the catails and weeds to knock on the slightly open trailer door. Melinda and Claire stepped out into the dry, Texas, heat to walk Joshua back to the cab of the truck. He would get quickly overwhelmed by new guests, and the cab made a comfortable, soundproof, kennel. Mike stepped inside and commented on how cozy it was. Commenting on how cozy the trailer was was a way people got away with saying they had no idea how we lived in such a small place.

Mike pointed down at the book I had open, fanned down onto the page I was reading, and read the title aloud, "The GOD who WEEPS".

"Yeah, Oh man, I think you'd really like it."

"I stopped reading stuff like that a long time ago. Took reading the a bookshelf of Mormon faith-lit before I realized I didn't like them."

"It's a lot more down to earth say The Mirical of Forgiveness. The Givens see doubt and emotion as a necessary part of the cycle of fidning Faith."

"Ha," Mike shrugged quickly, "should have caught me last year," he said as he looked over his shoulder and said, softer, "we stopped going to church a year ago."

Claire found out the next day, and stood panicked, mid laundry load, trying to appear understanding and relatable.

Mike and Melinda had recommended Big Bend. I think I had heard about Big Bend on an episode of West Wing. They told us a story of how Mexicans would swim accross the river and leave trinkets along the trails that you could leave money for. They had a small praying mantis made of wire they had aquired this way.

"Do you think that God had purpose in making things unfair, or is it a necessary byproduct of something else that he wanted," I asked as we took a turn South, down a dusty and empty road. The mountains surrounding us were lit light blue under a dark and starless sky. I didn't look up from the design on my laptop.

Claire rubbed her nose, and snorted, staring over at me blankly. After a few moments, she prodded, "what?"

"Do you remember when I said that God must be fair, or his love is not unconditional?"

"Yeah, well yeah. I remember. But, remind me."

I sighed and looked back at the design. Claire turned off the music and gave a penetrating glance. She tapped my knee a few times and reminded me that she was sitting right next to me.

"Can you give me a chance on this one. Like, sometimes you have to repeat things. I promise I'm listening, I promise I'm trying."

"I just don't know if you really are."

We could see as far as our headlights shown. We hadn't seen a car in an hour. Claire switched to the highbeams. The air was thick with musk of a fight we'd had too many times recently.

Finally I conceded, "The equation doesn't work for me anymore. I used to solve the privelege problem by saying that hardship was relative. The in-god's-hands philosphy said that my secular wealth brought a multitude of spiritual problems. Easier for a camel to fit through a needle's eye than get into the kingdom of heaven kind of stuff. But lately I'm beginning to see that life is in fact unfair. So I'm no longer solving the problem of why things appear unfair—now I'm solving the problem of why life actually is unfair.

"I have to be willing to believe that everyone is trying the best that they can, and that when Melinda says that the church gives her depression she really means it. And if church gives some people depression, and others elation, we're talking about a God given system not having equal benefits for all people. Doesn't seem fair.

"So. Do you think that God had purpose in making things unfair, or is it a necessary byproduct of something else that he wanted?"

Claire was lost in thought. A heavy frown set in, and her grip on the steering wheel looked tight.

In that moment, things felt very slow. Life felt very long and this relationship felt more difficult than was bearable. All things are relative to the observer. Things were not actually slower, things were not actually more difficult. I was a party who was seeing things not as a third party observer would have recalled them.

"I guess I think that Melinda just isn't trying hard enough."

Big Bend is along the border of Texas and Mexico. It's secluded and serene. It's untouched by culture and enterprise but feels very American. While I was in that open, secluded place, I started to understand the insignificance of my life, and the significance of the universe. While we were there I was an observer who was seeing the universe on a new scale.

Each year, during fall and spring break, the observatory an hour North of big bend holds a star party. I'm retroactively interested, now, by the intersection of those two opposing scales: a telescope helps humanity know its standing in the grand scheme and a college party helps humanity know its standing with girls named Hilary, Nicole, and Rachel.

The great paradox of relativity is that the most familiar perspective is the one given the least power, while the most familiar perspective is also the one that is most important to the one observing it. The view I had of the stars that night was nothing new, and a photo of it would mean nothing to science at large, but in that moment it was the most significant perspective I had ever been given of the universe. When we look up at the familiar stars, we often forget what they mean—their familiarity is what makes them foreign.

That was not my space, it didn't live on my scale, and it would not speak to me. It would not answer my questions, and its fresh perspective would not accompany me through the daytime.

Seneca said, “provided I may look upon the sun and the moon and gaze at the other planets; provided I may trace their risings and settings, their periods and the causes of their travelling faster or slower; provided I may behold all the stars that shine at night (...) provided I can commune with these and, so far as humans may, associate with the divine, and provided I can keep my mind always directed upwards, striving for a vision of kindred things – what does it matter what ground I stand on?” 

The same is so with my skin. The dandruff I get each winter, the sunburns in the spring, and softness of my hands—this is the skin I know. But show me the cells under a microscope and I will see nothing in it that is mine. The cells that make up my body are not mine, for they don't live on the scale by which I observe life.

That November day at Big Bend, Claire and I were living on different scales. Often, ironically, that was what we fought about. I was used to the tactless arguments I had been raised with. I wanted to break down the details and build them up from scratch. Claire wanted to plan out a lifetime. I was the recepies, Claire was the cookbook. The book doesn't see itself as a compilation of recipies any more than I consider myself a compilation of cells.

Claire had a pretty interesting story arch until she met me and I attempted to iron out of the compelling wrinkles. Third of three girls from a family of accomplished scientists, she was: a fenominal athlete, a creative and passionate illustrator, a brilliant student (scoring a 32 on the ACT), and awarded a full ride scholarship to attend BYU. All of that slipped that first semester at BYU.

"I would fantasize about walking onto the Women's soccer team while sleeping through my senior level art classes."

Anson Dorrance, a mormon, Women's Soccer Coach at NCU known for having one of the most successful coaching records in the history of athletics was her hero. Claire appreciated his focus on hustle and discipline. Anson's secret, she learned from The Man Watching, was in how he picked his line-up using a rough count of how many times players had sprinted for a take. He had a whole team of assistants quantifying hustle.

"I was devistated when I realized that I was no longer the smartest student in the class."

By the time I met Claire she was on her fifth year as a undergrad with no near end in sight.

Andrew was our first interview for what turned out to be an eighteen month long interview project. We started the project so that we could figure out how to be satisfied.

He sat on a plush couch with his sockless legs crossed, his all beige outfit cuffed at every opening. His long curly hair looked particularly boyish in his outfit. I was not confident he remembered that we were coming over to film the interview this day.

We had practiced interviewing with other friends, but nothing can prepare you for the stress of trying to bring out and then capture, live. Our passion for story telling didn't compensate for our lack of experience with the tools and the format.

"Can you please hold this while you're talking," I asked, showing a frustration I usually reserved for private conversations, handing her our backup camera.

Reluctantly taking it, Claire made a frustrated face while trying to twist the lens into focus while pressing the back of the camera to her chest. Her hand carelessly drooped toward the ground.

"Wait, why didn't you tell us about these before? Hang on, hang-on-hang-on. You said that the weirdest part about mormonism was that they beleive in Aliens."

"There are many competing, lateral, levels of Mormon weirdness", I said, thinking to myself of the many things that scandalize teenagers when they first come upon anti-mormon literature. "The concept is actually pretty common, especially with Judeo-Christians. If I was talking to Jews or Catholics, or pretty much any orthodox audience they would quickly find parallels. It's really only foreign to protestants, of which we all are."

"How do you figure?"

"The orthodox have their Clerical stuff, Jews have kippahs, and Islam its headscarves and burqas. Considering how pecuiliar Mormons are, garments are actually pretty practical. Only the wearer is reminded of their existance, which really speaks to the Mormon aesthetic: be a truly good person, not look like a good person."

"There's this story that Mormons tell, about how they managed to get a campus in Jerusalem. Without any sort of preaching, the property was secured because of the 'twinkle' in the eyes of the Mormons who came to negotiate the deal. No angel came to them in a vision, no God of Abraham using his miraculous power to make way for His Purposes. The subtle moremon aesthetic, and the philosphy of the hidden commitment of the garments can be summed up in the importance of a 'twinkle in the eye'."

I stopped wearing garments in the parking lot of a Sams Club in Cincinatti, Ohio.

Claire was standing, hunched, in the small door frame of the Airstream. I could see her emotions from accross the parking lot. At that time everything between us was palpable. 

"You bought them then," she stated, arm jutting squarely into her hip.

"I'll just try them for a bit and see how it feels," I said, unable to pull the Sam's Club sized pack of Haynes classics out from the bag while she was watching. I was ashamed of myself.

The great God that Kyle Wayne Benson worships is not perfect. I have imagined up a judgement day where He looks on the heart in every case but mine. When my turn came he’d look at the way my shirt hangs on my frame and my worthiness would be apparent.

Had I died a deacon; God-willing I would have remembered to put on underwear at all for my celestial court date. And think of the state of my hair!

------

Just beyond the cap sleeve of her garment top showed a beveled and ridged scar—one of many evidences of being struck by a car five years before.

"You are just letting it all hang out," I said, tugging on the corner of her revealed garments.

"Men show their garments all the time. Sorry this shirt is such a mess. It's just so swear word comfortable."

"It looks comfortable," I said gently.

"Garments were not made for bobs like mine." Bob being the name she gave to her jr. sized boobs. "There are women who get breast implants just so they can fill out their garments."

"Garments weren't made for big boobs either. Garments weren't made for boobs," I muttered confidently from absolutely zero point of reference.

"Yeah, I suppose so. They're getting better though. This top came out a few years ago," she said, tugging on the same place that I had grabbed, "and I said a sweet prayer of gratitude."

I pulled her in a little closer and slowly ran my hand over the many bumpy scars on her back.

"Garments always made me feel fat," I said with a sigh. "Lately I have felt drawn toward going to church, but I'm pretty far from wanting to feel like that again," I said, tugging the hem of her shirt down again.

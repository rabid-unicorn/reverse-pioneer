I stopped wearing garments in the parking lot of a Sams Club in Cincinatti, Ohio.

In July of 2014 I decided to stop shoving aside heaps of light grey holy garments to get to my black secular garments. I too little faith to believe I was doing anything righteous by keeping them among my wardrobe, but I had just enough belief to not throw them out that day, but . So I bagged up the mess and took them down to the storage space beneath the house.

I unceremoniously tossed them in the far corner near the water heater.

Big Bend National Park is in the middle of nowhere. It's about three hours drive from a gas station. But it can seem a lot longer when you're fighting the entire drive.

Claire was standing, hunched, in the small door frame of the Airstream. I could see her emotions from accross the parking lot. Everything between us was palpable then.

"You bought them then," she stated, arm jutting squarely into her hip.

"I'll just try them for a bit and see how it feels," I said, unable to pull the Sam's Club sized pack of Haynes classics out from the bag while she was watching.

The great God that Kyle Wayne Benson worships is not perfect. I have imagined up a judgement day where He looks on the heart in every case but mine. When my turn came he’d look at the way my shirt hangs on my frame and my worthiness would be apparent.

Had I died a deacon; God-willing I would have remembered to put on underwear at all for my celestial court date. And think of the state of my hair!

I suppose that even the basement isn’t far enough for them to be considered abandoned. Does my God give leeway to those who recycle their old garments as shop rags?

But I wish I could abandon them. More than that I wish I could wear them and feel that they meant what they once did.

I’m sure he uses measuring tape for those judgements. Using a ruler would look silly.

The man upstairs has a record collection as diverse and eclectic as any you've ever seen. Sure, when he plays shows, he mostly just samples the stuff you've already heard, and he doesn't take requests, but if you get a group of your friends together and shout loud enough he might just satiate your request.

Remember when alternative bands started adding disk jokeys in the early two-thousands? It's kind of hard to forget the more than excitable dude standing in the back triggering [samples at his whim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilqGBvMP1-M). Well, God is a lot bit like a DJ. He's pretty good at remixing your average, albeit alternative, life into something special.

I like to think of him as the inventor of the rap-rock crossover (could Linkin Park have really thought it up on their own?). He's also the guy who started taking old Mary Ford vinyls and speeding them up so they sound like classic Bollywood and are pretty easy to rap over. Our Lord is also pretty good at sampling scratched vinyl to censure out those curses He knows you'll try to sneak in.

We play on an adult soccer league in the summer that is no stranger injury. Old dudes are loaded with testosterone. 

One year an older man wore baseball cleats to a game and kicked the keeper in the face with one of them. 

During a sunny, Saturday morning, game in June, Mary Wilson (a spectator no less) had the wind knocked from her two year old's lungs by a stray ball. We all have our crosses to bear.

We had a forward who, the year previous, had been knocked onto his head—breaking that part of him that kept his legs and arms functionally connected to his brain. Still here he was playing harder and running faster than I had seen a leg-arm-brain-broken type person run before. His wife reminded us of how grateful she was for the sheer number of prayers that were given that brought him back to health and out of Jesus' arms and back into hers. One less prayer and who knows what kind of a misserable vegetable she'd now be married to and changing the diaper of.

Good for her. She had gotten that careless dipshit of a DJ to stop playing house and trance for just long enough to play her song (Rockaby, is the name of the song that heals that particular bone if you must ask). Good on her picking the right song and for demanding it loud enough.

One more song, one more song.

If that DJ hadn’t started playing dubstep, his injury would have never happened in the first place.

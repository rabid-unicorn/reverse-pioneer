The man upstairs has a record collection as diverse and eclectic as any you've ever seen. Sure, when he plays shows, he mostly just samples the stuff you've already heard, and he doesn't take requests, but if you get a group of your friends together and shout loud enough he might just satiate your request.

Remember when alternative bands started adding disk jokeys to their starting line-up? Lest we forget the more than excitable fellow standing in the back triggering [samples at his whim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilqGBvMP1-M). Well, God is that band member to every person's life. You bet your buns he can remix your average, albeit alternative, song of life into a rap-rock crossover even Linkin Park couldn't have dreamed up. He's also pretty good at playing vinyl scratch noises in the place of curses in your lyrics. 

We play on an adult soccer league in the summer that is no stranger injury. Old dudes are loaded with testosterone. 

One year an older man wore baseball cleats to a game and kicked the keeper in the face with one of them. 

Mary Willson, a spectator, had the wind knocked from her two year old's lungs by a stray ball. We all have our crosses to bear.

We had a forward who, the year previous, had been knocked onto his head—breaking that part of him that kept his legs and arms functionally connected to his brain. Still here he was playing harder and running faster than I had seen a leg-arm-brain-broken type person even day dream about running. His wife reminded us of how grateful she was for the sheer number of prayers that were given and you know what else it was what brought him back to health and out of Jesus' arms and back into hers. 

Good for here. She had gotten that careless dipshit of a DJ to stop playing house and trance for just long enough to play her song (Rockaby, is the name of the song that heals that particular bone if you must ask). Good on her picking the right song and for demanding it loud enough.

One more song, one more song.

If that DJ hadn’t started playing dubstep, his injury would have never happened in the first place.

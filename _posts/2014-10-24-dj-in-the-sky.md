The man upstairs has a record collection as diverse and eclectic as any you've ever seen. Sure, when he plays shows, he mostly just samples the stuff you've already heard, and he doesn't take requests, but if you get a group of your friends together and shout loud enough he may honor your wishes.

Remember when alternative bands started adding disk jokeys to their starting line-up? Lest we forget the more than excitable fellow standing in the back triggering [samples at his whim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilqGBvMP1-M). Well, God is that band member to every person's life. You bet your buns he can remixing your average sounding, albeit alternative, life.

During the summer we play on an adult soccer league that is no stranger to personal injury. One year an older man wore baseball cleats to a game and acciggressively kicked the keeper in the face with them. That same year we had a striker who the year previous had been knocked onto his head, breaking some part of him that kept his legs and arms functioning—but here he was playing harder and running faster than I had seen any paraplegic run. His wife told us the sheer number of prayers was what brought him back to health. She had gotten that careless dipshit of a DJ to stop playing House for long enough to play her song. Good on her for screaming loud enough. 

If that DJ hadn’t started playing dubstep, his injury would have never happened in the first place.

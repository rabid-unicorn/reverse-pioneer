The man upstairs has a record collection as diverse and eclectic as any you've ever seen. Sure, when he plays shows, he mostly just samples the stuff you've already heard, and he doesn't take requests, but if you get a group of your friends together and shout loud enough he might just satiate you.

Remember when alternative bands started adding disk jokeys in the early two-thousands? It's kind of hard to forget the more than excitable dude standing in the back triggering poorly synthesized disk scratch [samples at his whim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilqGBvMP1-M). Well, degrading though it may seem, God is your in house DJ. He's pretty good at remixing your average, albeit alternative, life into something special (when it was the late 90s anyway).

I like to think of him as the inventor of the rap-rock crossover (could Linkin Park have really thought it up on their own?). He's also the guy who started taking old Mary Ford vinyls and speeding them up so they sound like classic Bollywood and are pretty easy to rap over. In addition, Our Lord scratches vinyl to censure out all those curses He knows you'll try to sneak in. Which is to say: he does the radio edit.

I play on an adult soccer league in the summer that is no stranger injury. Old dudes are loaded with testosterone built up from years of suppressed jizzum. During a sunny, Saturday morning, game in June an octogenarian wore baseball cleats to a game and jizzum-power-kicked the keeper in the face with them. We all have our crosses to bear.

On the team was a forward who, the year previous, had been knocked onto his head—breaking that part of him that kept his legs and arms functionally connected to his brain. Still here he was playing harder and running faster than I had seen a leg-arm-brain-broken type person run before. 

Megan Smith, his wife, gathered us all 'round to remind us of how grateful she was for the sheer number of prayers that were given that brought him back to health and out of Jesus' arms and back into hers and now playing soccer in the great circle of life. One less prayer and who knows what kind of a misserable vegetable she'd now be married to and changing the diaper of. Makes you think.

Good for her. She had gathered enough of her friends together and chanted just loud enough that that careless dipshit of a DJ stopped playing house and trance to play her song (Rockaby, is the name of the song that heals that particular bone if you must ask). Good on her picking the right song and for demanding it loud enough.

I can't help but think to ask: One more song, one more song.

If that DJ hadn’t played dubstep, last year, his injury would have never happened in the first place.

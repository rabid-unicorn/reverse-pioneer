This is my morning prayer, lately:

Dear God, this hurts. I miss when life was fun. Help me understand my future. Life is teaching me that morality is subjective, but I'm not comfortable with that. Do you really care what I eat? Were you proud of me when I was vegan? Are you more proud of me when I find happiness in some of life's simple pleasures?

This is what I say to everyone else:

Are you surprised that I pray? Did you think I asked God about deciding to leave the Church? Iâ€™m seeking after truth earnestly. Perhaps I'm not using the same instruments that you are, but only because those instruments started to fail me. Sometimes I wonder if the assumption on my narrative is that I saw a fork in the road and choose the easy way. For all the friends I've lost, I wonder if my name is slandered amongst them.

It's difficult to give up on something that comes easily. My life feels like paddling upstream. Why am I doing this? Wasn't the other direction way easier?

And it was easier then. I was doing the right thing, and I was doing it well, and I was happy. I'm so busy paddling that I've lost my ability to be truly present. Now I find myself sobbing at my desk at work, getting caught up in nostalgia or over-sentementalizing my relationship with my chickens or some shit like that.

My departure from the church was sudden. Someone died and I missed my chance to have a laugh with them. It feels like the last goodbye to something unimaginably valuable. But some days I still have God, and for the most part that is the same. For lost to me is not my God, but my people. And that is my greatest pain.

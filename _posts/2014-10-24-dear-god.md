Dear God this hurts, and it is not fun. Did you not think I’ve asked God about the decisions I’m making? Did you not think I’m seeking after truth just as you are? Do you think I saw a fork in the road and said, you know that way looks a lot easier? Walking the devil’s path seems like fun.

I would love to have my name slandered amongst friends.

It was so easy then. I was doing the right thing, and I was doing it well, and I was happy. When you're criticizing and scrutinizing something, it's easy to overlook sentiment and nostalgia.
I guess it's all just catching up to me today.
It's like someone died and you missed your last chance to have a laugh with them.
It felt like the last goodbye to something unimaginably valuable to me.

Lost to me is not my God, but my people.

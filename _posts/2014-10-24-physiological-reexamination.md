Two years ago, I began expressing to a trusted few some of my concerns with Mormonism. By ten months ago I had decided it was about time to buckle down and decided if I was in or I was out. At the time I believed in a world that provided options in binary outcomes. 1 or 0—yes or no. Eventually I had to add a 2: God only knows why—who the hell cares.

Back in those early days God liked people who were republicans much more than he liked democrats. 

And I was a democrat—God only knows why.

Be that as it may, I felt like I was using my small but strong moral compass to make the decisions that God needed me to (vote for Obama, use properly marked road crossings, and keep the toilet bowl clean). Relationships be damned, I was on the Lord’s mission. Anyone unable to understand this paragraph can please see also: Prayer, Personal Nature Of.

I make no claims to knowing God, but I do consider myself someone who understands the Guy. I’ve spent nearly my entire life trying to anyway. Most members of most religions who talk about knowing God a lot or a little are talking about the esoteric secrets they do or do not know within their sect. In that way, I know Mormon God like the back of a hand being held up to perform a baptism. But in the less literal sense, I have tried throughout my life to speak with God and keep a constant dialog with him in my heart—God only knows why. 

Surely the heart is a lousy communication device, but as far as I know its all I’ve got. Other than communicating with the Almighty, my heart has no qualifications as my spokesperson.

Unqualified though it may be, I’m proud of where it has gotten me in life.

Call me Mormon. Most people have, or did. I’m not sure if I’ve ever been Mormon enough for my mother's parents.

Mormon—those who don’t masterbate or booze up—if I ever do come around to allowing myself the popular pleasures that the doctrine forbids, I will be a Mormon still. Mormonism is so abrasive, it can’t help but be this way.

My friend Trevor told me that vulnerability is inherently interesting. So here I am, on page 1, being the most vulnerable that I can be: 

I don’t know what I’m doing with my life, and I’m not sure if leaving mormonism was the right choice.

I originally set out to write a journalistic account of my pilgrimage away from institutionalized Mormonism. But I quickly found trouble understanding how truth, all by itself, could be enough to tell this story.

I set out to tell the truth. I was into the truth back then. But why should I bother with truth when there are so many feelings to be felt? So I guess this is an account of fiction shrouded in truth. Kind of like me: a Secular Mormon. Afterall, isn’t it all fiction by perspective? Doesn’t it only matter if something is felt and in being felt so becomes real?
